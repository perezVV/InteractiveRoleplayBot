# Roleplay bot for Discord
A better README is in the works...

This project is open source. Anyone is free to use or contribute to this bot -- especially when I feel as though it's finished on my end.

Suggesting new features, ways to improve the code, and more is completely fine and encouraged.

Currently, this bot is a major work in progress being strewn together whenever I have a lick of free time. There is a lot of redundant, repetitive, and inconsistent code as well as certain things that I'm sure can be done better.

Ideally, I'd like to put my time and effort into polishing the code once I'm finished implementing all the initial features.

A guide on how to use it on your own server, as well as how to make use of its features, should be here eventually.

Thanks for stopping by.
